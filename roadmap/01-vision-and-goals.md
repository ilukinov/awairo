 # Vision and Goals

## Project Vision

"An Apple A Day" aims to evolve from a simple Pomodoro timer into a comprehensive widget dashboard platform where users can access, manage, and interact with multiple types of widgets in a unified interface. The platform will serve as a productivity hub, allowing users to customize their workspace with widgets ranging from simple information displays to interactive tools that can execute local commands or communicate with external services.

## Core Goals

1. **Extensibility**: Create a platform where new widgets can be easily developed, integrated, and distributed.

2. **Flexibility**: Support various widget types:
   - Information display (weather, stocks, calendar)
   - Interactive tools (Pomodoro timers, task lists, calculators)
   - System integration (command execution, file operations)
   - External services (API calls, web service integration)

3. **Reliability**: Build a stable foundation with comprehensive testing and error handling.

4. **Security**: Implement robust security models for widgets with different permission levels.

5. **Performance**: Ensure the application remains lightweight and responsive even with multiple widgets.

6. **Usability**: Create an intuitive interface for organizing, configuring, and interacting with widgets.

## Success Criteria

- **Technical**: The platform can support the development and integration of new widgets with minimal boilerplate code.
- **User Experience**: Users can easily add, remove, resize, and configure widgets.
- **Performance**: The application starts up in under 3 seconds and maintains responsive interactions.
- **Reliability**: The application maintains a 99.9% uptime on user machines with proper error recovery.
- **Security**: Widget permissions are properly isolated, preventing unauthorized access to system resources.

## Non-Goals (For Initial Phases)

- **Mobile Support**: Initially focusing on desktop platforms only.
- **Cloud Synchronization**: Starting with local storage only, cloud sync to be added later.
- **Complex Animations**: Keeping the UI simple and functional in early versions.
- **Third-party Widget Marketplace**: Will be implemented in later phases.

## Target Users

1. **Knowledge Workers**: Professionals who need quick access to various tools and information.
2. **Developers**: Users who want to automate tasks or integrate with development tools.
3. **Productivity Enthusiasts**: People who optimize their workflows and track their time use.
4. **System Administrators**: Users who need quick access to system information and commands.
